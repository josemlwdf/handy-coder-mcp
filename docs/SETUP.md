# Optional feature setup

Install JavaScript formatting support with `pip install '.[javascript-format]'`. This provides jsbeautifier formatting for `.js`, `.mjs`, and `.cjs` files; ESLint remains independently optional.

HTML files created or modified by `create_file` and `apply_edits` are automatically prettified with BeautifulSoup (`html.parser`). BeautifulSoup is installed as a required project dependency; formatter failures are reported while the requested file write is kept.

The main server registers `code_format_lint` and `web_fetch_docs` from `lib/extras`, plus `web_search` and local C# navigation tools. Other modules under `lib/extras` are not exposed unless explicitly registered.

Use `get_capabilities` first to confirm what is configured and currently available. Its `tools` section is the runtime source of truth for optional tool availability.
For optional tools, each `tools.<name>` entry may include `missing_requirements` and `setup_docs` to speed troubleshooting.

Tools blocked by missing packages, binaries, environment variables, or adapters return `status: "setup_required"` with `missing_requirements`, `remediation_commands`, and `documentation_url`. Tool-specific `error_code` values may be included for compatibility. Diagnostics and test execution responses include a `detection_trace` describing configured checks or the selected framework.

## Local C# code navigation

The server stores the workspace-specific SQLite database at `.handy-coder/code_index.sqlite3`. Call `index_codebase` to index C# source files; it updates changed files and removes entries for deleted files. Generated and tool-owned directories (including `.git`, `.handy-coder`, virtual environments, `Library`, `Temp`, `obj`, and `bin`) are excluded by default.

The `index_codebase` and `code_navigator` tools use the Tree-sitter C# parser and SQLite FTS5, included in the project dependencies. No remote index, embedding service, or vector database is used. The server starts without indexing; call `index_codebase` to build or refresh the index. Indexing runs in an isolated worker process, and parser or FTS5 initialization errors are reported by that tool.

`code_navigator` supports `search_code`, `get_symbol`, and `find_references`. Search is lexical, not embedding-based; reference results are syntactic candidates and are not compiler-resolved. See [SEMANTIC_SEARCH.md](./SEMANTIC_SEARCH.md) for tool details.

## Web tools

`web_search` uses DuckDuckGo Lite, and `web_fetch_docs` retrieves a known public HTTP(S) URL. Both need network access when called; web fetch blocks private, local, and reserved addresses. Use `web_search` to discover public pages and `web_fetch_docs` to read a known URL.

## Web fetching (`web_fetch_docs`)

`web_fetch_docs` fetches text from a known public HTTP(S) URL. Requests to private, local, or reserved addresses are blocked. Use `offset` to page through long responses.

## Test execution setup (`run_tests` / pytest)

For reliable pytest execution via `run_tests`:

- run from the workspace root
- keep tests in `test/` or `tests/`
- when tests import local packages (for example `from lib import support`), add `test/__init__.py`

Common pytest import failure:

- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lib'`

Recommended fixes:

1. create `test/__init__.py` (package marker)
2. ensure the tool invokes pytest as `python -m pytest` (the server does this)
3. run `run_tests` with `filter_path` to isolate failing targets while troubleshooting

## Quick verification

After configuration, call `get_capabilities` and verify expected flags under:

- `tools.*.available`
- `tools.*.configured` (where applicable)
- `tools.*.missing_requirements` (empty for fully configured optional tools)
- `tools.*.setup_docs` (for quick setup references)
- `env.*`
